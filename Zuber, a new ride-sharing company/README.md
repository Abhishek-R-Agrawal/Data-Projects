# Zuber Ride-Sharing Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the ride-sharing data for Zuber, a new company launching in Chicago. The objective is to uncover patterns in the available data to understand passenger preferences and how external factors like weather influence ride frequency.

## Project Description
As an analyst at Zuber, you are tasked with:
- Analyzing competitor data.
- Testing a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
- Providing insights on passenger preferences through data-driven analysis.

## Data Description
The project utilizes a SQL database containing information about taxi rides in Chicago segmented into several tables:
- **neighborhoods**: Contains data on city neighborhoods.
- **cabs**: Includes information on taxis.
- **trips**: Records details about individual rides.
- **weather_records**: Stores data on weather conditions.

## Requirements
### Software and Tools
- SQL Database Access: Ability to query a SQL database.
- SQL Client: A tool like DBeaver, pgAdmin, or similar is recommended for querying and managing the database.

### Technical Skills
- Advanced proficiency in SQL for complex queries.
- Basic data analysis skills to interpret query results.

### Data Access
- Proper credentials to access the Zuber database containing the relevant tables and records.

## Instructions on Completing the Project
### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze the number of rides for each taxi company on specific dates.
- Investigate the impact of taxi company branding on ride frequency during a selected week.

### Step 2: Hypothesis Testing
- Determine the effect of weather conditions on the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport.
- Use SQL queries to link trips data with weather conditions and analyze the findings.

## Setup Instructions
- Ensure you have access to the SQL database.
- Configure your SQL client to connect to the database using the provided credentials.

## How to Run the Project
- Execute SQL queries as described in the project steps to gather data and perform analysis.
- Document the findings and prepare a report summarizing the insights and recommendations.

## Collaboration and Version Control
- If working in a team, use Git for version control to manage changes and collaboration.
- Maintain communication through platforms like Slack or email for project discussions.

## Conclusion
This README provides a structured path for navigating the Zuber project. By following the outlined steps and utilizing the required tools and skills, stakeholders and analysts can effectively analyze the ride-sharing data to aid Zuber in its strategic decision-making.
