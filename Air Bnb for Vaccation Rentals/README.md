- **Start Here**: Introduction and project scope.
- **Assumptions and Cleaning Steps**: Log of data cleaning and assumptions.
- **Listings and Analytical Tabs**: Analysis on occupancy rates, popular booking days, and potential annual revenues.

## Assumptions
- Removal of non-superhost listings.
- Exclusion of listings with review ratings of 3 or below.
- Filtering of listings with no reviews in the past 12 months.
- Application of data cleaning techniques like proper capitalization and use of rounding functions to maintain consistency.

## Process
- Data cleaning including normalization of text fields and deletion of redundant columns.
- Use of advanced Excel functions for calculation and data transformation.

## Findings
- The Lower East Side shows an average price per night of $308 with an occupancy rate of 63%.
- The potential annual revenue for properties in this area is over $70,000.

## Recommendations
- Investing in one-bedroom properties in the Lower East Side for highest profitability.
- Leverage superhost status and instant booking features to increase rental income and occupancy rates.
